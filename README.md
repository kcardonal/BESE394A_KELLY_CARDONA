## Exercises for course BESE394A "Understanding bioinformatics pipelines" 

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of bioinformatics pipelines tailored for various high-throughput sequencing data types. The goal of this project is to serve as an educational resource for a course that covers the following data types and methodologies:

- RNA-seq: Week 1 and 2
- ATAC-seq: Week 3
- Single-cell sequencing: Week 4 and 5
- Integrative analysis: Week 6 
- DNA methylation analysis: Week 7
- Spatial Transcriptomics : Final Project

Each directory within this repository contains the educational resources and exercises from each class (a.k.a week), including scripts, workflows, datasets, figures, etc.

For class 4 activities (week 4), please refer to: https://github.com/kcardonal/dea_seurat_Group2, which is forked from roblehmann/dea_seurat. 

The Group presentations folders contain slides of presentations in class describing specific pipelines, workflows, tools, or technical concepts.
